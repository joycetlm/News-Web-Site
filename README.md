---Give the story you like a praise: When you view a story and think it's interesting, you can click on the "like" button to give a praise on this story. There is a message that indicates how many people have given a praise to this story. You can give many praises to a same story several times.
---Public your information or not: If you'd like to let the people who view your story contact you, you can add your email address to your user information so that people can find a way to contact you. A viewer can get access to user information only if he/she has logged in.
